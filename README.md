# About 
This project is consisting of 2 parts since the name we have given as ‘Cyber Analysis Tool’ as it’s capable of finding multiple informations regarding domain address, IP address, signature of the files needs to be uploaded to verify that particular file is malicious or not, SHA/MD5 information, Analytic for various virus engines, graphical representation using the signature based algorithm using API. The technology we have used is ‘React JS’ for the front end, API connections interface and Machine learning concepts using python for comparative analysis. React JS is most widely used front end model which is written in JavaScript that is
used almost in all the major companies for development. This is easy to use and it has many plug ins and dependency which can be utilised in order to get a product based on the requirements. Using React, We can also use html, CSS and styled components to get an advanced looking web page experience. In API perspective, We have taken multiple APIs for the case of using the data source and then we need to take the essential plug ins compatible with the requirements.
